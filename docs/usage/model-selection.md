# Model Selection

Switch between different AI models to optimize for speed, capability, or cost.

## What are Models?

Models are different versions of the AI with varying capabilities:

- **Larger models**: More capable, better reasoning, slower, higher cost
- **Smaller models**: Faster responses, lower cost, good for simpler tasks
