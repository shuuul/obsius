# Mode Selection

Some agents support different operational modes that change how the agent behaves.

## What are Modes?

Modes are predefined configurations that alter the agent's behavior for specific tasks. For example:

- **Default Mode**: General-purpose assistance
- **Plan Mode**: Focus on planning and architecture before implementation

## Changing Modes

1. Open the chat panel
2. Look for the **mode dropdown** below the input field
3. Select the desired mode from the available options

::: tip
Available modes depend on the active agent. Not all agents support multiple modes.

## Mode Persistence

The selected mode persists for the current session. Starting a new chat resets to the default mode.
