# ACP Protocol Support

This page documents which Agent Client Protocol (ACP) features are supported by this plugin.

## What is ACP?

The [Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) is an open standard for communication between AI agents and client applications. It defines how clients send prompts, receive responses, handle permissions, and manage sessions.

Obsius implements ACP as a **client**, communicating with ACP-compatible agents like Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini CLI.
